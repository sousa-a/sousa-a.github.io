Hi!<br><br>
I am a professional with expertise in data analytics, business intelligence, and management, I currently serve as Director at the Department of Health of the Federal District in Bras√≠lia, overseeing the budget for medications and health supplies across a network of 14 hospitals and 170+ primary care units.<br><br>
My technical skillset includes Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Statsmodel, Scikit-learn, SQL, databases, Power BI and others, which I leverage to develop predictive models, optimize resource allocation, and automate monitoring tools for procurement and inventory.<br><br>
